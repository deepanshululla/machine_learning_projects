### Project 7: Housing Data
* Uses [housing data for king county USA](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)
* Used different models (Decision tree, Linear Regression, Artifically neural networks) to predict the hosing prices based on number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, sqft_living, sqft_lot, number of floors, sqft_above, sqft_basement etc.
